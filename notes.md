# pPXf (Penalized PiXel-Fitting method)
- Used to extract gas/stellar kinematics and stellar population from absorption line spectra of galaxies.
- Can fit multiple gaseous/stellar components.

# LOKI
## Comments on LOKI's results
- The headers mention MIRI but the data is from NIRSpec.
- Maps at the different extensions of the output .fits file should be grouped by line (all measures of a specific line should be back-to-back) and they should be placed in alphabetical order so we can easily browse through the .pdf outputs and find the line we want to inspect. It could also be useful to provide a table of the extension number of each line in the .fits file.

# Ideas
- Compare my results with every of the four cooling models given in the introduction.
- Even if the BH mass can be calculated as planned with the ionized gas mass, it could be interesting to compare this result to what is predicted by the $M_\textrm{BH}-\sigma$ relation and the NIR BH mass - Pa-$\alpha$ luminosity relation (see ref. 30)
