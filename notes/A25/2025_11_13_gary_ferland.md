# Gary Ferland meeting (CLOUDY) without Gary Ferland
- How can you tell that the stellar dispersion does not contain metallicity effects
    - Metals in the atmosphere of stars affect how the photons escape
    - Velocity should be ok, but for velocity dispersion, there is going to be an effect
    - There shouldn't be a strong difference in metallicity in the field (about 600 pc), so changes in velocity dispersion should mean that the stellar component REALLY changes and not the metallicity. The metallicity
    - Equivalent width of absorption lines:
- First "paper" is the letter which compares Pa $\alpha$ to the simulations from Minghao. We could use a fit only on the Pa $\alpha$ for this.
- We should use the entire spectrum fit for our papers
- We could compare the fits

### After
- Create a When2meet in the first week of december with Michael, emphasize that we need the "final" fitting for the end of January (include Olivia, Julie, Joseph, Jorge and Michael)
