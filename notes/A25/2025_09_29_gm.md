# Group Meeting
- For next year, maybe think of a proposal to get observing time (1 deadline in march and another in september/october). Gemini, ...
- No PAH features in the data.
- Interesting regions : filaments, disk, AGN, top-right star cluster?
- The PSF is about 2 pixels, so no features 


- Why don't we just bin the data 2x2? : just keep it in mind when analyzing
- Careful of using the psf, resolution, sampling

- 1st pretty figure : mostly images, include MUSE velocity field, xray, halpha, showing where the NIRSpec pointing is
- alma section is gonna be pretty short (there's no clear detection)
- Make a draft of figure 1 : presenting the object (xray, halpha, muse velocity field, NIRSpec pointing).
- Second figure : flux, velocity, dispersion of the lines (for the gas and for the stars) 3_1_Results.png (kinematics of all the main emission lines and main absorption lines), maybe add contours of the ratio jets, position of the AGN
- Only draft of figures! Once everyone agrees, I can start actually making the figure.
- Maybe apply for a scholarship for doing an internship with [mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-award/)
