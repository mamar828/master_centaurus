# Group Meeting
- Review the list of subjects to talk with Michael
- Show intro

Questions
---
- Are there any other measurements of kinematics/velocity dispersion than the Nature one I found?

Feedback
---
- [x] Tweak words: massive galaxy clusters -> all galaxies (they sit in all galaxies)
- [x] add radio jet specifically (lines 13-15)
- [x] last sentence of first paragraph (thought to regulate)
- [x] Mention clearly that it is the second nearest cluster. M87 is closer, but it has a super high luminosity (very hard to subtract the PSF) (that's why we don't use it) (it also has a smaller angular size)
- [x] Change "perfect example" in the one before last (classic example?). The word "perfect" is too strong.
- [x] For next week, suggest figures in each section of the results section
- Potential S parameter vs ellipticity plot (separate elliptical galaxies from spiral) (since we don't have the stellar mass in every spaxel, it might be difficult)
- [x] Section 4 : add a subsection for the comparison to the outer kinematics (from MUSE)
- [x] Sigma of the stars vs gas in Olivares 2019
- For the end of december: have the figures in each section, [probably have the observations section completed]

TODO
---
- [x] Send email to Michael with the list of subjects to discuss
- [x] Finish intro
- [ ] Start Observations section
- [x] Prepare figures to include in each results section
