# Group Meeting
Radio maps
---
- I converted the maps to FITS files. Extracted the frequencies from the headers.
- I have multiple versions of the same frequencies. There seems to be differences in resolutions/binning.
    - 8.3: two resolutions (SUB is a subregion of the high resolution image).
    - I also have HST WFPC2 images: CENT-P and U62G8401.
    - 4.8: two resolutions.
    - 1.7: two resolutions.
    - 0.324: CENT_PBAND=CENTAUR-330MHZ, CENT-P_324MHz is the same but with WCS offsetted.
- I am waiting to be sure that we have everything before confirming to Greg Taylor that all is good.

LOKI Meeting
---
- Did everyone fill out the form?
- Select a time and date.

Paper
---
- I now specifically address BCGs in the first paragraph.
- A lot more info on each model was added.
Few questions:
- AGN or AGNs ? (same with BCG or BCGs?)
- In addition to Olivia's paper, should I mention future papers in the intro?
- Show the bullet points for the remainder of the intro.

Notes
---
- [x] Our BH are all in the radio mode of AGN feedback.
- [x] Mechanical and heating are two modes, rephrase.
- [x] Basically only include our mode (Fabian review).
- [x] Remove sentence of lines 14-15.
- Equivalent modes: radio/mechanical/kinetic/radiatively inefficient.
- Other mode: quasar/thermal/radiatively efficient/wind.
- [x] Add references in the explanation of models.
---
- [x] Email LOKI
- [x] Email Greg Taylor
- [x] Finalize paper intro draft
