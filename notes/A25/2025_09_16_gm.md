# Group Meeting
Pre:
- Michael Reefe gave the fit results for each spaxel in csv files.
- Verify the number of components to adjust the fit
- Verify the component matching (e.g. in HI_Br_beta.vmed.pdf, most components are close to 0, but sometimes some pixels have 400 km/s).
- Some maps are very granulated
Post:
- For next week: have the overleaf sections laid out
Eventually:
- Fit only the very well fitted absorption lines for the velocity fields (we don't need all the other lines (some are not well fitted but are unimportant))
- RESULT: Decoupling of the velocity field with the velocity dispersion of the stellar populations (look at the two figures in continuum/ vdisp and vel)
- Maybe look at radio observations to see if jets are perpendicular to observed features.
