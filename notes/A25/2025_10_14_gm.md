# Group Meeting
Questions:
- What is the policy on coordinates on figures? In my earlier works, we always indicated the coordinates on the figures but it seems to be omitted in many papers I read now.
- velocity dispersion sigma or FWHM?

Only add arrows for N/E and not RA/DEC

fig 1
- muse bottom right
- add muse FOV box on the top right
- make the figure more rectangle
- Identify the AGN and filaments with arrows
- bottom right and top right have the same zoom, NIRSpec box on the bottom right
- x kpc only (arcsec not necessary)

fig 2:
- Continuum for the flux of stellar kinematics
- two separate colorbars on the left at the bottom and one global for each column on the two right columns
- maybe tilt the data to fill the whole frame and add arrows to identify the direction of coordinates
- ∆v -> sigma
- make sure FWHM and not sigma

- first paper: its enough to compare the gas with one component/stellar with ALMA
- beautiful figure: maybe add radio on top of Halpha and X-ray?
