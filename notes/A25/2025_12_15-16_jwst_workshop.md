# JWST Workshop
## Discussion with Étienne Artigau:
- The stellar population we mainly have are M dwarfs. We can see this from the depth of the CO band heads $\implies$ deeper CO band heads $=$ cooler stars.
- He sent me a template for a NIRISS M dwarf spectrum (LHS 1140) that I could use to fit the continuum better.
  - The absorption feature at 1.8 microns seems to be in that spectrum.
  - The feature at 1.845 microns is in a region of the spectrum where there is nothing. We didn't see it in another spectrum he showed me.
- We could get the temperature of the stars from the depth of the CO band heads.

- Loki only gives us the total SNR fits, not per component.
## VSFs
- I used a normalization by the variance, but this doesn't affect the slope of the VSF. It just changes the y-axis scaling.
## Questions
-  Why do we take $z=0.0099$ when the proposal uses $z=0.0104$?
