## VSFs in Centaurus
- Gatuzz et al. (2023) did VSFs and PDFs of the hot gas in Centaurus using XMM-Newton data.
  - They have very high variance.
  - They have very few points and low SNR.
- Ganguly et al. (2023) did VSFs of the cold gas in filaments of multiple CC clusters including Centaurus using MUSE and ALMA data.
  - The VSF is steeper than the classical Kolmogorov expectation.
  - They find a slope of 0.61
