# Mini mergers with major consequences in a CDM universe
- Gravitational lensing and the dynamic of gas in galaxies give a good proof of DM. CMB is an even greater proof.
- Major mergers are rare collisions between similar-mass galaxies. They cause:
	- Enhanced SVF
	- Enhanced SMBH accretion rates
	- Post-coalescence quenching
	- Structural change (during and after the merger)
- Primordial BH have been ruled out of being a significant part of DM since we do not see enough microlensing events that should occur if we were to point a telescope at the galactic bulge for example.
- It's very hard to have matter power spectrum measurements of low-mass haloes.
- Asymmetry of a galaxy is an excellent measure of SFR (strong asymmetry=strong SFR).
- Galaxy bars are very hard to reproduce in simulations because it requires very strong resolution.
- Contrastive learning is used to study galaxy morphology.

## Summary
- Mini mergers drive small enhancement in asymmetry and SF on long timescales.
- Low-mass collision are responsible for more asymmetric structure than minor/major mergers combined in the CDM.
- The abundance of low-mass halos is compatible with DM physics. Mini collisions might offer indirect DM constraints.
