# Michael Reefe meeting (LOKI) to discuss the second fitting results
Questions
---
- Is there an easy way with LOKI to extract the complete fitted model for a single spaxel? For example, let's say we want to recreate the spaxel_plots figures for a specific spaxel ourselves and put it in our own figure, what do you recommend for doing that?
- Do you have any insights on how we could get a stellar mass from the fits with multiple components? We want to use this as a measure of "flux".
- The FWHM of many spaxels hits the upper limit of 800 km/s. Physically, we would like to be able to fit broader lines than this limit. Is there also a way to make sure the fit converges to a FWHM lower than the upper limit? We can see this behaviour in many FWHM param maps (e.g. H210_O2 from the "full" recent run). **Prepare figure to show this.**

- Pa alpha and S(3) with two components in the paper, one component for the others.
