# Online JWST Workshop (noted on November 5th)
S transitions:
- Vibrational state from 1 to 0 and the S means $∆J =-$, the number (e.g. S(8)) is the final J level
- They probe different temperatures (each vary by a couple thousand Kelvins at most)
- In the center, the H$_2$ emission lines are less intense
Q transitions:
- $∆J = $0
O transitions:
- $∆J = +$
Br $\beta$ is matched with Pa $\alpha$ so the fit is constrained to match amplitudes
