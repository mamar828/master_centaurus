# Group Meeting
Greg Taylor:
- VLBA: bt83
- VLBA: weird scale?
- I only have 330MHz VLA
- The scale of the VLA map is weird (inversely)
- CENT_PBAND=CENTAUR-330MHZ

Notes for the paper
---
If I give measures in arcsecs, also give the equivalent in parsecs.
- 1st paragraph
    - more specific: [talk about BCG directly]
    - When I mention BCG, stay with BCG, shock fronts, jets [make sure that what I mention afterwards is applicable to BCG]
    - (line 10) x-rays probe the emission very close to the BH: this is only for small galaxies, and in clusters it's for the jets and you don't see the center as clearly
- 2nd paragraph
    - how it regulates, twice as long (emphasis with the models, a sentence or two for each model)
    - the flow of this gas is all connected
    - McNamara's model: dragging material that triggers instabilities

**TODO**:
- Answer to Greg Taylor and ask if he has any other data
