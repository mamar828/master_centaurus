# Group Meeting
Greg Taylor:
- VLBA: bt83
- VLBA: weird scale?
- I only have 330MHz VLA
- The scale of the VLA map is weird (inversely)
- CENT_PBAND=CENTAUR-330MHZ

In the paper:
If I give measures in arcsecs, also give the equivalent in parsecs.

TODO:
- Answer to Greg Taylor and ask if he has any other data
