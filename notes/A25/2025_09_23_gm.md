# Group Meeting
For next week:
- Have the list of figures for each section in the paper.
- Look at the Grant Tremblay paper and add figures/sections.
- Maybe more sections? The discussion sections are not final.
Eventually:
- Use only a single component for the first paper.
- Two components for the second paper (maybe with KinMS).
- Do plots similar to everything from Tremblay.
