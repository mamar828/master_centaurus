# Gary Ferland Meeting (CLOUDY)
- Molecular hydrogen is often created in an excited state.
- Excitation diagrams: get the temperature from the first few points.
- Very strong molecular hydrogen emission. (Fabian and Ferland argued it was from cosmic rays). What is the power source? Where does the gas get heated from?
- We could make a BPT diagram from the molecular hydrogen lines (no one has actually ever done it).
- From the emissivity, you can take the surface brightness and compute the column density of molecular hydrogen which tells us if the emission comes from a thin filament or a thick cloud.
- Paschen alpha and bracket gamma confirm us that we have ionized gas.
- If we had good X-ray data, we could potentially see the cooling flow over the entire cluster. Map CLOUDY predictions to the X-ray data.
