# Group Meeting
New data from Michael following Joseph's suggestions:
It has improved a lot but is still not quite there yet.
For example, the fwhm maxing out problem is still present in some lines but is mostly fixed. Joseph also didn't mention this problem directly, so this only stems from a better fit.
Figures:
I looked at the units from LOKI's documentation and everything seems right.
I added the "gas" and \star subscripts
I added the names of the lines
Email to Fabian:
the data actually come from the 2006 paper, should I mention this one instead? (fig. 4)
Also Taylor is the author of the 2006 paper
He shows Chandra data in his 2006 paper. Do we have it?
Are VLA observations useful? (present in the 2006 paper)
Verify email
Intro:
I wrote bullet points and started collecting relevant papers for each

AFTER
-
Regions:
To see the stellar cluster, HST 1060 filter (stellar filter)
Filament region bigger/more extended
Figures
Stellar masses are typically shown per unit of area, so it would be interesting to divide by the angular area of each pixel to get this more relevant value.

make a list/table of all the maybe pertinent data of both articles, make sure it's only in "xA" configuration and ask Julie if we have it/it's needed
send a draft email to Julie addressed to Greg Taylor and cc Fabian which asks for specific
look at the chandra data with Ben. Maybe?
